Cosmic Expansion Mechanism | Analysis of Future Trends in Cosmic Expansion

At the cosmic boundary, adjacent Space-Energy Quantization (SEQ) units lack external coordination points, generating an intrinsic expansion tendency driven by the initial kinetic energy released during the universe's birth—a plausible mechanism for cosmic expansion. According to this model, the expansion of the universe would progressively decelerate due to the restorative force, which arises as the macroscopic manifestation of gravity. This force stems from the tension in stretched SEQ bonds. Once the deceleration phase concludes (i.e., when the initial kinetic energy from the Big Bang is predominantly converted into the elastic potential energy of spacetime, stored in these stretched SEQ bonds), the universe enters a contraction phase until the SEQ spacing reverts to equilibrium. Notably, this contraction does not revert the universe to its primordial state, nor does it reduce entropy—since the trend of increasing entropy persists unchanged during both expansion and contraction. The homogenization of energy distribution remains an irreversible process throughout this cycle.

## Key Points:

Expansion Trigger:Absence of outward coordination in SEQ units at the cosmic edge, fueled by primordial kinetic energy.

Deceleration & Contraction: Restorative gravitational force from stretched SEQ bonds eventually reverses expansion into contraction.

Entropy & Irreversibility: Entropy continues to rise regardless of expansion/contraction, ensuring energy homogenization is permanent.
